# We are aware that there are mass bans of different magnitudes being experienced by a lot of the bot users with symptoms such as:
1. Bot being able to login, and catch pokemon but NOT spin forts
2. Bot being able to login, NOT catch pokemon (vanishing) but able to spin forts
4. Some accounts not being able to login at all

We are also aware of the getting stuck between 2 forts and getting caught in an infinite loop

2. Have you searched to see if there are other issues for the same issue? If so, comment on that issue instead.
3. Are you running `master`? We work on the `dev` branch and then add that functionality to `master`. Your issue may be fixed on `dev` and there is no need for this issue, just wait and it will eventually be merged to `master`.
